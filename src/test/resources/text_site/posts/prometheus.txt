<p>Sir?</p>

<p>Hold; while Prometheus is about it, I'll order a complete man after a desirable pattern. Imprimis, fifty feet high in his socks; then, chest modelled after the Thames Tunnel; then, legs with roots to 'em, to stay in one place; then, arms three feet through the wrist; no heart at all, brass forehead, and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains; and let me see&mdash;shall I order eyes to see outwards? No, but put a sky-light on top of his head to illuminate inwards. There, take the order, and away.</p>

<p>Now, what's he speaking about, and who's he speaking to, I should like to know? Shall I keep standing here? (ASIDE).</p>

<p>'Tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome; here's one. No, no, no; I must have a lantern.</p>

<p>Ho, ho! That's it, hey? Here are two, sir; one will serve my turn.</p>

<p>What art thou thrusting that thief-catcher into my face for, man? Thrusted light is worse than presented pistols.</p>
