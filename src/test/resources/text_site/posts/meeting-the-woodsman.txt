<p>"True," the Tin Woodman returned.  "So, if you will allow me to join your party, I will also go to the Emerald City and ask Oz to help me."</p>

<p>"Come along," said the Scarecrow heartily, and Dorothy added that she would be pleased to have his company.  So the Tin Woodman shouldered his axe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the road that was paved with yellow brick.</p>

<p>The Tin Woodman had asked Dorothy to put the oil-can in her basket. "For," he said, "if I should get caught in the rain, and rust again, I would need the oil-can badly."</p>

<p>It was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party, for soon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place where the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the travelers could not pass.  But the Tin Woodman set to work with his axe and chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire party.</p>

<p>Dorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not notice when the Scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the side of the road.  Indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up again.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you walk around the hole?" asked the Tin Woodman.</p>
