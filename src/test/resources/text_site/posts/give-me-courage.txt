<p>"Come in," said Oz.</p>

<p>"I have come for my courage," announced the Lion, entering the room.</p>

<p>"Very well," answered the little man; "I will get it for you."</p>

<p>He went to a cupboard and reaching up to a high shelf took down a square green bottle, the contents of which he poured into a green-gold dish, beautifully carved.  Placing this before the Cowardly Lion, who sniffed at it as if he did not like it, the Wizard said:</p>

<p>"Drink."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked the Lion.</p>

<p>"Well," answered Oz, "if it were inside of you, it would be courage. You know, of course, that courage is always inside one; so that this really cannot be called courage until you have swallowed it.  Therefore I advise you to drink it as soon as possible."</p>
