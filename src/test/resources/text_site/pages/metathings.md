Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful!

## The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz

I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it! I'll get my kit!
