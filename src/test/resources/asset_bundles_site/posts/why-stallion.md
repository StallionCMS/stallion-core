Why Stallion?
============================

I wrote Stallion because I was not happy with the existing state of blog engines.

My goals were:

1. My blog should never go down due to any reasonable traffic load. If one of my posts go viral, my blog should stay up.
2. I want to write my posts in emacs and store them on my local hard-drive, so that I know that I will have them forever.
3. I want updates to be quick. I do not want to have to re-generate a web site every time I make a minor change.
4. I want the engine to be powerful. I want to be able to include any possible listing page, filter page, etc.
5. I don't want major hassle with cache expiration. It should work with a CDN but without me having to worry about expiring the cache on my javascript or CSS.
6. I want to be able to develop my templates locally, in my own IDE, and then be able to deploy the site 
7. I want my site to live in a file system so that I can use github or Dropbox to maintain backups and version history.
